A Web application for Buy, Exchange, Sell of items. Aimed for a college environment where physical communication is very easy between sellers and buyers. Hence,This can be used very effectively. For example, exchange of novels, buying second-hand books from seniors etc.

Every newbie entering college has to face an initial period of hustle where he's confused as to where he can get all important goods required for his day to day life. He wanders around for stuff like books(required for his curriculum), drafters, calculators etc. At the same time when a guy moves from the 1st to the 2nd year there are alot of things which become useless to him. For example- a guy in the 1st year needs bicycle which a 4th year student has no use of.

Our website provides a common platform for the sellers and the buyers where the sellers put up goods for sale. The buyer can find the best price for a particular item. By this, the buyers no longer need to keep moving from senior to senior looking for goods which he needs.
